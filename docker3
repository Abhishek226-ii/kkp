container do not have ip address
80 port in http present also in container and ec2 instance
we cant change the port of container
we can connect the container and user through port mapping
map menas host and container mapped
docker run -td --nmae techserver -p 80:80 host:container
-td onnly for dokcer not go inside the container
expose command only container can talk but cant connect to other user

docker port--> details about the port

docker attach.. main process in container
docker exec..> take u inside the container nad start the new process

difference betweeen docker execute and docker attach

docker exec creates a new process in the container environmnet while docker atach just connect the standard input/op of the main process isnside the ccontainer to corresponding standard i/op error of current terminal

docker exec is specifically used for running new things

difference between expose and publish a docker

BAsically you have three options:-

neither specify expose nor -p
only specify expose
specify expose and -p

if you neither expose nor -p the service in the container will only be accessible from inside the container itself

if you expose a port the service in container is not accessible from outside docker but from inside other docker containers so this is good for inter container communication

if u expose and -p a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere evven outside docker.

if u do -p but do not expose docekr does an implicit expose this is because, if a port is open to the public, it is automatically also to the other docker container hence -p includees.

to create the container only for showing not going inside
 docker run -td --name techserver -p 80:80 ubuntu /bin/bash
here we create a container name tech server on port 80 and the image is ubuntu

docker port techserver..> to check the port server
docker exec -it techserver /bin/bash ..> to go into the container
